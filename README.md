# Smart Home Automation with ESP32

This project demonstrates a Smart Home Automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows for manual control of various household devices like lights, fans, and more through both physical switches and a web interface. The system is designed to automate and remotely control a house's appliances while monitoring environmental conditions using sensors.

## Project Features

- **Control via Web Interface**: Users can control appliances such as lights, fans, and TVs through a simple and intuitive web-based dashboard.
- **Manual Switch Control**: Physical switches are still available for manual control of connected devices.
- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: The system monitors and displays real-time temperature and humidity levels in the kitchen.
- **PIR Motion Detection**: Automatically detects motion in the bathroom and turns on the lights accordingly.
- **Fire Detection (Future)**: A fire detection system is planned for future updates to improve safety.

## How It Works

The system is built using the following components:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Handles the logic and web server.
- **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Detects motion in the bathroom.
- **Relays**: Controls the electrical appliances (lights, fans, TV, etc.).
- **Web Dashboard**: Allows users to control devices remotely through a Wi-Fi connection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vipulraj0152/SmartHome.git
    ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your ESP32.

3. Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network by editing the following lines in the code:
    ```cpp
    const char* ssid = "YourSSID";
    const char* password = "YourPassword";
    ```

4. Open the IP address assigned to the ESP32 in your web browser to access the Smart Home dashboard.
